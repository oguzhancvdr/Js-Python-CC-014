> <br> [6, 10, 14, 27, 42, 51]

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this coding challange, you will be able to;

- Analyze a problem, identify and apply programming knowledge for appropriate solution.
- Demonstrate your knowledge of algorithmic design principles by using JavaScript and Python

## Problem Statement
- Write a function that generates an array ranging from 1 to 49( inclusive ) and shift random six elements to the beginning of the array. Delete other elements(7 and beyond) of the array and sort the remaining numbers. This function should return these 6 numbers in a sorted ascending array.
- You are expected to define only one array for purpose of the project, using spare array is not permitted.
